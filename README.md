# NoKursery
I made a Discord GuildRank bot with MongoDB, Mongoose, MEE6 API and Djs.  
Unlike MEE6, this time if someone swears, not only is that message deleted, but their XP, level is also decreased. 
If they swear too much, they are kicked and banned. So it is a super cool bot that appreciates good behaviour and punishes bad one.


NoKursery is a bot that helps your server be wholesome and friendly. The bot provides:

	1.Profanity Filter
	2.Mass Emoji Detection  
	3.Rankings and Levels 
	4.Comparisons with MEE6
	5.Kick/Ban (For Admins) and Welcome Messages 


made with MongoDB, Djs and love!

To install use

	$npm install

followed by 

	$nodemon index.js


NOTE: You need Node and Djsv12 or above to work on this code. Hope you like the project!
